‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Attack Risk Prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the risk of a heart attack based on patient health indicators. It uses a structured clinical dataset and demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
üß† Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing or incorrect values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Correlation heatmap

Distribution plots

Feature importance analysis

Modeling:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees / Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting

Model Evaluation:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC Curve

‚úÖ Results
Achieved high classification accuracy with strong recall and precision, making the model potentially useful for clinical decision support in early heart disease detection.

üí° Key Learnings
Importance of data normalization and feature selection in health data.

Understanding medical indicators and their statistical relationships.

Comparative analysis of classification models on imbalanced health data.
